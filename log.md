# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Ch. 6 of the Michael Hartl [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users#code-validates_format_of_email) and started the Treehouse Ruby tutorial again.  

**Time Logged:** 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Feels good to commit to this. The RoR tutorial is coming along well and I think the Treehouse stuff will be great a filler for times when it's hard to get learning in. Also, this will help me get my person Jeykll site finally up and running. üëçüèª
