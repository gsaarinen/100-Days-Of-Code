# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Back to the [Hartl RoR Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/basic_login) and was able to finish Ch. 7 which focused on user sign up.

**Time Logged:** 1.25 hour

**Thoughts:** It was a pretty technical chapter but I was grasp a large chunk of it. I think at some point I should go back and review it all. Throughout most of the exercises I was able to get them figured out on the first try so - WOOHOO me üòâ.

### Day 9: January 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Focused on the Ruby Basics tutorials on Treehouse.com.

**Time Logged:** 1 hour

**Thoughts:** It was nice to change it up today a little and get into more of the core Ruby. This is a core area that I need to focus on and once the Hartl RoR tutorial is done I think I'm going to split my time between personal projects and basic Ruby stuff.

### Day 8: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the Rails tutorial, left off at section 7.4.4.

**Time Logged:** 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Finished getting a successful user signup workflow going in the rails app. Started to understand how you would use `flash[:success]` when confirming a successful signup.

### Day 7: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the Rails tutorial at my parents.

**Time Logged:** 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Brought my laptop to my parents this weekend so I could continue my streak while on vacation. Wrote test today on user signup validation and error handling. The exercises are starting to get more vague but I've still been able to figure them out. It's giving me more confidence. üòé

### Day 6: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the Rails tutorial at Code Club.

**Time Logged:** .75 hours

**Thoughts:** Was able to get in time at work during our Code Club meeting which will be really helpful on Friday's. Ch. 7 is starting to stretch my technical knowledge but I really like it as it's pushing me. I'm really starting to understand how some of the general aspects of a rails web applications works.

### Day 5: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the Rails tutorial.

**Time Logged:** .75 hours

**Thoughts:** OOoooof. Today was particularly hard to find time. Spent a lot of the evening finishing a report for work. But, I still pushed through and got some time in. While today's time does come slightly under the 1 hr per day commitment I made - I'm still pretty proud that I pushed through and still did some work. üëäüèª

### Day 4: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the Rails tutorial. Started getting into `params` on objects and it's starting to make sense how they are worked in HTTP requests.

**Time Logged:** 1 hour

**Thoughts:** Tough to get the time in today but still did it. So much to do - so little time. Glad I still kept the streak going. the idea of `:params` is starting to make sense as it was something that really escaped me before.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued Ch. 7 of the [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up).

**Time Logged:** 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Knocked out getting the form gravatar and form completed. Proud that I was able to figure out one issue one my CSS where the gravatar wasn't displaying. It turns out that for some reason the Image tag was set to `Display: none;` which was odd.

Also frustrated that it took me about 10 minutes to figure out why my form wasn't showing up. Turns out that = signs are important and my form started off as:
`<% from_for(@user) do |f| %>`
...but should have been
`<%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>`
Oh how much of a difference an equal sign makes lol!

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fished Ch. 6 and started Ch. 7 of the Michael Hartl [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/sign_up). Also, continued some of the Treehouse Ruby tutorials.

**Time Logged:** 2.5 hours

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit during the day as I tried to get some of my work in with the kids at home but found a lot more free time during the evening.

### Day 1: January 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Ch. 6 of the Michael Hartl [Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users#code-validates_format_of_email) and started the Treehouse Ruby tutorial again.  

**Time Logged:** 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Feels good to commit to this. The RoR tutorial is coming along well and I think the Treehouse stuff will be great a filler for times when it's hard to get learning in. Also, this will help me get my personal Jeykll site finally up and running. üëçüèª
